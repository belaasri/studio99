- Background color: Light gray (#EAEAEA), derived from the Electric Indigo hue, ensures content visibility and a modern feel with low saturation.
- Accent color: Shocking Pink (#FC0FC0), an analogous color to Electric Indigo, providing contrast for interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, provides a modern, neutral look for both headlines and body text, ensuring readability and a clean aesthetic.
- Use minimalistic, modern icons related to video downloading and sharing. Use icons consistently across the app for a unified look.
- Maintain a clean, intuitive layout with a focus on ease of use. Prioritize the video ID input field and download button for prominent placement.
- Incorporate subtle animations for loading states and button interactions to provide user feedback without being intrusive.
